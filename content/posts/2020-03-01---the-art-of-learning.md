All throughout school, I was generally a very average student, who had a variety of interests and passions. It wasn't until my final high school exams where I really honed in on my ability to learn and develop myself through metacognitive reflection. Here are a collection of points that really changed me for the better, and concepts I apply to all areas of my life:

- **Getting the general idea of what a concept is trying to achieve or trying to say is important** <br/>
  This gives you greater understanding of the concept in the bigger picture, and allows you to make higher level connections. What this means in practice is, be cautious of simply learning for the sake of learning (i.e. passive learning), or getting too caught up in getting the details right. Sometimes you only need a high level understanding of everything.
- **Try to rephrase every important concept or idea in your own words or diagrams** <br/>
  There is a reason why making notes work. It's the process of sifting the knowledge, and summarising it, in your own way and your own thought processes. This allows you to really **own** the idea.
- **Note what type of learner you are, and use it to your advantage** <br/>
  I was most definitely a visual learner, so I drew out concepts and flow charts quite often, to deepen my understanding of a concept.
- **When problem solving, exhaust your toolkit** <br/>
  Try not to cheat by looking at answers too soon, there's a lot of merit and benefit in solving something yourself. Use the art of deduction, if it's not working, approach the problem differently.
- **Be careful of mental biases** <br/>
  Existing mental biases about the way things work can stop us from completely accepting and understanding a new concept.
- **Observe others who are great in their field, and learn from them** <br/>
  If I had a superpower, this would probably be it. I'm incredibly attuned to observing the way people go about work, interactions and daily life. Whenever I meet someone really genius at their craft, I would get to know them better and understand the process and the habits which they implement in their lives to achieve their successes.

Life is short and there are so many things I want to try and learn. And so I am on a journey to continuously improve the way I learn and pick up new skills.
