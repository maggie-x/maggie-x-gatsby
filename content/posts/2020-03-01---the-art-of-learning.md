All throughout highschool, I was generally an average IQ student, who had a variety of passions and worked hard to get better at those passions. It wasn't until my final high school exams (the HSC) where I really honed in on my intellect by metacognitively reflecting and improving myself. Here are a collection of points that really changed me for the better, and concepts I practice to this day:

- **Getting the general idea of what a concept is trying to achieve or trying to say is important**
	This gives you greater understanding of the concept in the bigger picture, and allows you to make higher level connections. What this means in practice is, be cautious of taking notes or diving too deep into detail. Sometimes you only need a high level understanding of everything. 
- **Try to rephrase every important concept or idea in your own words or diagrams**
	There is a reason why making notes work. It's the process of sifting the knowledge, and summarising it, in your own way and your own thought processes. This allows you to really **own** the idea. 
- **Note what type of learner you are, and use it to your advantage**
	I was most definitely a visual learner, so I drew out concepts and flow charts quite often, to deepen my understanding of a subject.
- **When problem solving, exhaust your toolkit**
	Usually for STEM subjects, for example in Mathematics, questions give you all the information you need. Use the art of deduction, if it's not working, approach the problem differently.
- **Be careful of mental biases**
	Existing mental biases about the way things work can stop us from completely accepting and understanding a new concept.
