Hi there!

My name is Maggie, and I'm a final year **Computer Science** student studying at UNSW 🎓.
I'm very passionate and intrigued by tech, and the power it has to make an impact on the world 🌍.

I've had quite a bit of experience in front-end development, having worked with React, Angular, Vue, Typescript.

But I've also had exposure to various backend technologies, such as AWS services (Lambda, Cloudformation), as well as REST API development.

In the future, I'm looking to getting into data analytics and data science, hoping to leverage the world's data for the greater good!

I also have a creative side of me, which is expressed through my interests in UX/UI design, and my ~~hobby~~ passion **dance**, in particular street dance and hiphop culture 💃.

There is such a vibrant global street dance community all connected through one language, and I hope to travel, dance and meet people around the world!

And also, I love to learning languages, and have studied in Chinese and Japanese 🇨🇳 🇯🇵 .
